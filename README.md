# Primal Rites

I'm not fixed on the name yet, but it's a game about creating a community of humans in the beginings of prehistory and see them develop cultures, religions and art.

## gbforth

[gbforth](https://github.com/ams-hackers/gbforth) is an awesome project from Amsterdam, providing an easy way to write games in Forth for the Game Boy.

I wanted to try out the project and see how it goes.
